Then using the counts of each race executed by state I was able to pivot the data set so each state only had one row with columns white and person of color.

Also some of the states had only a few people executed which could skew percentages. Also in places like California and Texas, the percentage of people of color is higher, so the amount of people of color executed would naturally be higher. There aren’t any obvious racial biases, however some states do have a higher percentage of people of color executed. For example, Florida has a 40% poc execution rate while their overall person of color population is around 30%, and Florida has a lot of values in the data set. I might be interesting to do more in depth of analysis of this data to truly determine any biases."

    "text": "Casein is the main protein present in cow’s milk. It is good for building muscle and growth, as cow babies grow up on this protein. It has been shown to have many benefits for humans, especially for bodybuilders and people in recovery from injury. It is likely to have good growth benefits for other animals as well. One study, looked at growth rates for chicks who were fed different types of feed, one of which was supplemented with casein. By comparing weights of the chicks on casein vs. other feed, we can see the effect casein has on a chicks growth.\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis: Feeding your chicks casein will have no affect on their weight compared to other types of feed\nAlternative hypothesis: Feeding your chicks casein will have an affect on their weight.\nSpecifically, I think casein will make chicks heavier on average.\n\n\n\nI am starting out by using the chickwts data set described above.

For the purposes of this analysis I am classifying the chick weights as high if they are in the top 50% of weights and low if they are in the bottom 50% of weights.

The p-value represents the chance that we would get an observed difference that is equal to or above the difference that we got. Because our p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis that casein feed has no effect on chick weights compared to other types of feed.\n\n\n\nThe p-value can also be analyzed by a two sided test, instead of a one sided test. This would take into account the probability of getting the negative of our observed difference and lower. This would raise our p-value. It would be interesting to study chicks with a more consistent control group like the most common type of feed, instead of random feeds lumped together. It would also be interesting to pair this with an analysis of average chick weights at certain points in life in order to get a better understanding of a higher and lower weight chick. The data would also be more accurate with a larger sample size."
