I followed the same process we did for the North Carolina data. I downloaded the UCLA data. The code below uses the data set made from a fec16 package that filters for Wisconsin results only. Next, we can draw the districts for Wisconsin.

```{r}
wi_shp <- districts |>
  filter(STATENAME == "Wisconsin")
wi_shp |>
  st_geometry() |>
  plot(col = gray.colors(nrow(wi_shp)))


```

```{r}
#| output: false
wi_merged <- wi_shp |>
  st_transform(4326) |>
  inner_join(wi_results, by = c("DISTRICT" = "district"))
head(wi_merged, width = Inf)
```

We can now show the results for the 2016 election and show which party one which district and the level of Democratic and Republican support for each.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false 

wi <- ggplot(data = wi_merged, aes(fill = winner)) +
  annotation_map_tile(zoom = 6, type = "osm", progress = "none") + 
  geom_sf(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual("Winner", values = c("blue", "red")) + 
  geom_sf_label(aes(label = DISTRICT), fill = "white") + 
  theme_void()
wi

wi +
  aes(fill = r_prop) + 
  scale_fill_distiller(
    "Proportion\nRepublican", 
    palette = "RdBu", 
    limits = c(0.0, 0.7)
  ) +
  labs(title= "Levels of Democratic and Republican Support by District in Wisconsin in 2016")
```

This map shows the voting breakdown for Wisconsin in 2016. Most of the districts in Wisconsin are majority republican. Two districts are completely democratic though, with a third district being less democratic but still democratic.
